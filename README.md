# CSharpProject
This is a project I designed in my first year of university in C#, it is a Pizza Delivery management app (for a restaurant called Pizza Pizzaz) and is an early example of my coding skills which also includes principles of test driven development and some OOP (although I didn't learn OOP until my second year so is rather basic).
